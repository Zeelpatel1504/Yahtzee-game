## Summary and Reflection

While working on the Yahtzee game, I tested its functionality on a colleague's MacBook to ensure it worked well across different platforms. I had initially planned to enhance the game's visual appeal by using dice images instead of numbers, but due to project restrictions on modifying the pubspec.yaml, I opted to stick with numbers. This required me to prioritize adherence to project guidelines over personal design preferences. Overall, this project was my first foray into developing a Yahtzee game, providing me with a practical and enriching experience in Flutter development.

I particularly enjoyed the challenge of implementing the game logic, which was a great exercise in problem-solving and applying Flutter's capabilities in a practical scenario.
